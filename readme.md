WooCommerce customer export script

This program generates a csv file with a list of your WooCommerce customers and their billing and shipping addresses. WooCommerce's official plugin to do this same function is $80 annually, but all this functionality is already exposed via their API. 

To use, add your API key and domain name and run the program. The output will appear in customers.csv
